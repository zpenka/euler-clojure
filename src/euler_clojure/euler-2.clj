; Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two
; terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13,
; 21, 34, 55, 89, â€¦ By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose
; values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.
